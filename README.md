## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This project uses a Jenkins pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment processes. Below is a summary of the main stages:

| Stage                   | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Checkout**            | Clone the `main` branch and get the current git commit SHA. |
| **Lint Codebase**       | Install dependencies and run ESLint to check for code issues. |
| **Build Docker Image**  | Build a Docker image tagged with the commit SHA version. |
| **Cleanup Existing Container** | Stop and remove any running containers with the same name. |
| **Run Docker Container**| Start a new container from the built image on port 3000. |
| **Tag and Push Latest** | Tag the image as `latest` for easy reference (pushing is optional). |

### Notifications
- On success, an email is sent to notify that the build and deployment succeeded.
- On failure, the container rolls back to the previous `latest` image and an email is sent with failure details.

---

This pipeline ensures automated testing, containerized deployment, and notification to maintain build health and quick recovery.
